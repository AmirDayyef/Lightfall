🌘 Lightfall

Lightfall is a dark 3D action adventure where light itself is your life.
You fight, block, and survive across three stages and a five-phase boss fight — each testing your reflexes and endurance.

🎮 Controls

WASD — Move

Space — Jump

Q — Block

E — Interact / Repel ghosts

Killing enemies restores your health and light — your lifeline in this world.

🕯️ Gameplay Overview
Stage 1 — The Cave (Tutorial)

Your first descent into the dark.
Learn to move, jump, and light your first altar to clear the stage.

Stage 2 — The Haunted Fields

You’ll face ghosts and knights.

Ghosts: Press E to shoo them away.
Fail, and they’ll possess you — spam E to break free.

Knights: Guard their ground fiercely. Get too close, and they’ll strike.

Stage 3 — The Broken Castle

Ruins filled with bats that swoop down and attack.
Light every altar to push back the dark and reach the throne room.

👑 Final Boss — The King of Shadows

A five-phase endurance fight:

Phase 1: Light attacks only.

Phase 2: Summons his guards.

Phase 3: Adds heavy swings and four bats.

Phase 4: Both guards and bats return together.

Phase 5: Everything comes for you — pure chaos.

⚙️ Goal

Light all the altars in each level to restore balance.
Survive long enough for your light to outlast the darkness.

🧠 Developer Note

I probably should’ve cloned something like FNAF or DOOM, come to think of it.
I definitely miscalculated how much time it would take to build an original idea from zero,
but I’m happy with how it turned out — and I’ve learned a lot from the process.
