## 🧠 Developer Note

Halfway through development, I realized 2D animation was **way harder than I thought** —  
so I scrapped the old version and **restarted the whole game in 3D**.  
It was a huge risk, but I decided to **shoot for the stars** and make something entirely my own.  

I probably should’ve cloned something like **FNAF** or **DOOM**, come to think of it.  
I definitely **miscalculated** how much time it would take to build an **original idea from zero**,  
but I’m happy with how it turned out — and I’ve learned **a lot** from the process.
